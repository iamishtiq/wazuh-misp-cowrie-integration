# 🔐 Wazuh + MISP + Cowrie Honeypot Integration (SOC Lab)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real-world **Security Operations Center (SOC)** workflow by integrating:

- **Wazuh SIEM** for log collection, correlation, and alerting  
- **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)** for external threat intelligence  
- **Cowrie SSH Honeypot** for deception-based attack detection  

The objective is to detect live attacks, enrich alerts with threat intelligence, and analyze attacker behavior in a controlled lab environment, similar to enterprise SOC operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Integrate MISP threat intelligence with Wazuh SIEM  
- Deploy a Cowrie SSH honeypot to capture real attack activity  
- Correlate honeypot events with MISP Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  
- Analyze enriched alerts in the Wazuh Dashboard  
- Understand how threat intelligence and deception improve SOC detection and response  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
This lab simulates an enterprise SOC architecture where external intelligence and live attack data are combined to improve detection accuracy.

### 🔹 Architecture Flow
- Attacks are launched from a Kali Linux attacker machine  
- The Cowrie SSH honeypot captures malicious activity (brute-force attempts, login behavior)  
- Logs are forwarded via Wazuh Agent  
- Wazuh Manager analyzes logs and applies detection rules  
- MISP enriches alerts with threat intelligence (malicious IPs, domains)  
- Correlated alerts are visualized in the Wazuh Dashboard

### 🔹 Enabled Threat Feeds
The following feeds were enabled to ingest high-quality threat intelligence:

- **Botvrij.eu** – Botnet and C2 infrastructure  
- **Feodo Tracker** – Banking trojans (Dridex / Feodo)  
- **URLhaus** – Malicious URLs and malware distribution

- [Threat Feed Enabled (Additional View)](screenshots/misp/18-enable-feed-2.png)


---

### 🔹 MISP API Integration with Wazuh
- A dedicated MISP API key was generated for the Wazuh server  
- Wazuh uses this key to fetch IOCs securely  
- Indicators include malicious IP addresses, domains, and URLs
